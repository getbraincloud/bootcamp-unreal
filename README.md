## Notes

The example Unreal project in this repository contains the final code that was modified in Lesson 18 of the brainCloud BootCamp learning series. In this lesson, the example Unreal project is updated to get the list of global entities using the Level indexed-id. The game's spawner then uses the global entity data to properly spawn asteroids and enemies with the desired ranged-values for the example game's horde mode.

Since Unreal 5 project are not backwards compatible with Unreal 4, the Unreal BootCamp lessons have separate repositories for Unreal 4.27 and 5.1 projects. Each lesson's branch is post-fixed with _5.1 or _4.27.
