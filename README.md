## Installation Guide

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getbraincloud/bootcamp-unreal.git
cd bootcamp-unreal
git checkout Lesson-24_5.1
```

## Notes

The example Unreal project in this repository contains the final code that was modified in Lesson 24 of the Unreal BootCamp. In this lesson, the example Unreal project is updated to check for progress toward earning an achievement and awarding the achievement and updating brainCloud if that progress is completed.

Since an Unreal 5 project is not backwards compatible with Unreal 4, the Unreal BootCamp lessons have separate repositories for Unreal 4.27 and 5.1 projects. Each lesson's branch is post-fixed with _5.1 or _4.27.
