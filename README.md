## Notes

The example Unreal project in this repository contains the final code that was modified in Lesson 31 of the brainCloud BootCamp learning series. In this lesson, the example Unreal project is updated to implement external authentication with Twitch using OAuth 2.0.

This project has had helper code added for the OAuth 2.0 flow to help speed up the pace of the lesson.

Since Unreal 5 project are not backwards compatible with Unreal 4, the Unreal BootCamp lessons have separate repositories for Unreal 4.27 and 5.1 projects. Each lesson's branch is post-fixed with _5.1 or _4.27.
