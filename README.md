## Installation Guide

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getbraincloud/bootcamp-unreal.git
cd bootcamp-unreal
git checkout Lesson-14_5.1
```

## Notes

The example Unreal project in this repository contains the final code that was modified in Lesson 14 of the Unreal BootCamp. In this lesson, the example Unreal project is updated to request and display a leaderboard. The leaderboard was setup on the brainCloud portal in lesson 13.

Since an Unreal 5 project is not backwards compatible with Unreal 4, the Unreal BootCamp lessons have separate repositories for Unreal 4.27 and 5.1 projects. Each lesson's branch is post-fixed with _5.1 or _4.27.
