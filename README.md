## Installation Guide

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getbraincloud/BootCamp-Unreal.git
cd BootCamp-Unreal
git checkout Initial-Project_5.1
```

## Notes

The example project in this repository intentionally does not contain the brainCloud client in the Unreal project. This project is intended to be the starting code for lesson 03 in the brainCloud BootCamp learning series.

Since Unreal 5 project are not backwards compatible with Unreal 4, the Unreal BootCamp lessons have separate repositories for Unreal 4.27 and 5.1 projects. Each lesson's branch is post-fixed with _5.1 or _4.27.
