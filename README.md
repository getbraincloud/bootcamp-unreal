## Notes

The example Unreal project in this repository contains the final code that was modified in Lesson 03 of the brainCloud BootCamp learning series. In this lesson, the brainCloud client was added the example Unreal project.

Since Unreal 5 project are not backwards compatible with Unreal 4, the Unreal BootCamp lessons have separate repositories for Unreal 4.27 and 5.1 projects. Each lesson's branch is post-fixed with _5.1 or _4.27.
