cd BootCamp-Unreal
git checkout Lesson-6_4.27
```

## Notes

The example Unreal project in this repository contains the final code that was modified in Lesson 06 of the brainCloud BootCamp learning series. In this lesson, the example Unreal project is setup to authenticate with the brainCloud servers using an anonymous identity.

Since Unreal 5 project are not backwards compatible with Unreal 4, the Unreal BootCamp lessons have separate repositories for Unreal 4.27 and 5.1 projects. Each lesson's branch is post-fixed with _5.1 or _4.27.
